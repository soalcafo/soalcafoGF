# Decision Log

Resolutions to the open questions from [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) §13. Newest round appended at the bottom.

## Round 1 — 2026-06-28

| # | Question | Decision | Impact on build |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Timeline scope — include catalog trainings with no session/enrollment? | **No** — timeline shows only dated items (sessions, dated enrollments, completions). No "Unscheduled" lane. | Drop unscheduled-lane logic; simpler timeline queries. |
| 3 | Do workers log in? | **Yes** — workers can have their own logins. | Wire `WORKER` role + invitation onboarding into Phase 0 auth; worker portal screens stay in Phase 1b. |
| 4 | Catalog visibility | **Full published catalog (`ALL_PUBLISHED`)** for every customer. | Defer entitled-subset logic (`CatalogEntitlement`) until a customer needs it. |
| 5 | GDPR retention / lawful basis per category (PT/EU) | **Deferred — needs client DPO.** Safe EU defaults used meanwhile: retention 5 years; mandatory training = `LEGAL_OBLIGATION`; national ID NOT collected. | Values are configurable; confirm with DPO before go-live. No Phase 0 block. |
| 6 | Existing-platform integration shape | **Deferred to Phase 4.** Design stays integration-ready. | No Phase 0 impact. |
| 7 | Hosting / processors | **Deferred**, with one firm constraint: **EU data residency**. Default plan = EU-region managed services (e.g. Vercel `fra1` + Neon EU) with SCCs; fully-EU self-host remains a fallback. Decide before first production deploy. | No application-code impact; decide before deploy. |
| 2 | Facility ↔ customer worker-PII default | **Top admins only** — `FACILITY_ADMIN` may view customer worker PII directly (every access audited); `FACILITY_STAFF` see only anonymized/aggregated data. The owning customer's HR always sees their own workers. | Phase 0 builds role-based PII masking: PII unmasked for `FACILITY_ADMIN` (audited) + owning-tenant HR; masked for `FACILITY_STAFF`. RLS still enforces tenant isolation underneath. |
